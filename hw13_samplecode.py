"""### Architecture_Design

In this homework, you have to design a smaller network and make it perform well. Apparently, a well-designed architecture is crucial for such task. Here, we introduce the depthwise and pointwise convolution. These variants of convolution are some common techniques for architecture design when it comes to network compression.

After introducing depthwise and pointwise convolutions, let's define the **student network architecture**. Here, we have a very simple network formed by some regular convolution layers and pooling layers. You can replace the regular convolution layers with the depthwise and pointwise convolutions. In this way, you can further increase the depth or the width of your network architecture.

"""### Knowledge_Distillation

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/H2aF7Rv.png=100x" width="400px">

Since we have a learned big model, let it teach the other small model. In implementation, let the training target be the prediction of big model instead of the ground truth.

**Why it works?**
* If the data is not clean, then the prediction of big model could ignore the noise of the data with wrong labeled.
* There might have some relations between classes, so soft labels from teacher model might be useful. For example, Number 8 is more similar to 6, 9, 0 than 1, 7.


**How to implement?**
* $Loss = \alpha T^2 \times KL(p || q) + (1-\alpha)(\text{Original Cross Entropy Loss}), \text{where } p=softmax(\frac{\text{student's logits}}{T}), \text{and } q=softmax(\frac{\text{teacher's logits}}{T})$
